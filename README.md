# setup [![Actions Status](https://github.com/Andy9822/setup/workflows/linux/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Andy9822/setup/actions)

We all know the pain in the a$$ that is downloading and configuring all our setup after every freshly install of a new OS. Thus I've decided to create a single automated script to do all the chaos and hard work for me.

## Tools and Technologies

I'll keep updating the scripts with some frequency (I hope) but by now the following stuff is being installed and configured:

### Ubuntu
- NodeJS
    - nvm
    - node 14
    - yarn

## Usage
I've used Makefile to make my life easyest as possible so for configuring Linux just have to run

```make ```



There's also a Windows version, in this case have to run

```make windows```
